## Nodes

### vi_node

This node executes value iteration.

#### how to execute value iteration

The value iteration procedure rises up through the action `value_iteration/ViAction`, which is composed of the following goal, feedback, and result. An example of usage is shown in [vi_turtle_env.py](https://github.com/ryuichiueda/value_iteration/blob/main/scripts/vi_turtle_env.py).

* /vi_controller/goal
    * goal ([geometry_msgs/PoseStamped](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PoseStamped.html))
        * the destination
* /vi_controller/feedback
    * current_sweep_times (std_msgs/UInt32MultiArray)
        * the number of sweeps executed so far by each thread
    * deltas (std_msgs/Float32MultiArray)
        * the maximum change of state values caused by the latest sweep of each thread
* /vi_controller/result
    * finished (bool)
        * return true after the completion of value iteration

#### Services

* policy ([grid_map_msgs/GetGridMap](http://docs.ros.org/en/kinetic/api/grid_map_msgs/html/srv/GetGridMap.html))
    * Provide calculated policy. The id of the optimal action is written as a float value in each cell.
* value ([grid_map_msgs/GetGridMap](http://docs.ros.org/en/kinetic/api/grid_map_msgs/html/srv/GetGridMap.html))
    * Provide calculated value function.
* action_list (not implemented)
    * Provide the id and velocity of every action.

#### Services Called

* static_map ([nav_msgs/GetMap](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/nav_msgs/html/srv/GetMap.html))
    * Initiate the map for value iteration.
* cost_map ([nav_msgs/GetMap](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/nav_msgs/html/srv/GetMap.html))
    * It can be used instead of `static_map`. (please read Maps section)

#### Subscribed Topics

* scan ([sensor_msgs/LaserScan](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html))
    * laser scans
* tf ([tf/tfMessage](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/tf/html/msg/tfMessage.html))
    * transforms

#### Published Topics

* /cmd_vel ([geometry_msgs/Twist](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html))
    * the control order to the robot; published only when the parameter `online` is true


#### Parameters

* action_list
    * Currently, `vi_node` requires an action list like the following. `onestep_forward_m` and `onestep_rotation_deg` mean the forward and rotational velocities respectively. `vi_node` calculates the optimal value function and the oplimal policy based on this action list.

```
  <rosparam>
    vi_node:
      action_list:
        - name: forward
          onestep_forward_m: 0.3
          onestep_rotation_deg: 0.0
        - name: back
          onestep_forward_m: -0.2
          onestep_rotation_deg: 0.0
        - name: right
          onestep_forward_m: 0.0
          onestep_rotation_deg: -20.0
        - name: left
          onestep_forward_m: 0.0
          onestep_rotation_deg: 20.0
  </rosparam>
```

* ~online (bool, defalut: false)
    * flag for using vi_node as a real-time planner
* ~theta_cell_num (int, default: 60) 
    * number of intervals of the discrete state space on theta-axis
* ~thread_num (int, default: 4) 
    * number of threads used on value iteration
* ~goal_margin_radius (double, default: 0.2[m]) 
    * radius of the goal on xy-plane
* ~goal_margin_theta (int, default: 10[deg]) 
    * radius of the goal on theta-axis
* ~map_type (string, "cost" or "occupancy", default: occupancy) 
    * choice of map for setting immediate costs and occupancy (please read the Maps section)
* ~cost_drawing_threshold (int, default: 60[s]) 
    * cost value related to the maximum gradation color

#### Maps

We can choose two types of maps for initializing parametes of states. 

##### occupancy mode: 

A cost map is created from an occupancy grid map. Occupied cells are marked as roped-off area. Moreover, cells near occupied ones are given immediate penalty. The near cells and the value of the penalty are controlled through the following parametes. 

* parapeters
    * ~safety_radius (double, default: 0.2[m]) 
        * distance that should be kept between the center of the robot and an occupancy grid 
    * ~safety_radius_penalty (double, default: 30[s], max: 1,000,000,000[s]) 
        * immediate penality (negative immediate reward in the field of reinforcement learning) when the robot invades the safety radius. 

##### cost mode:

We can also use a "cost map," which contains the immediate cost of every cell. This map should be written with "[Raw mode](http://wiki.ros.org/map_server#Raw)". In a map, cells given 255 are regarded as roped-off cells. Cells with other values are free cells but are given the values as their immediate costs. 

There are an information file (`cost.yaml`) and a map file (`cost.pgm`) in the `maps` directory. The information file must contains the line `mode: raw` as shown below.

```
image: ./cost.pgm
resolution: 0.050000
origin: [-10.000000, -10.000000, 0.000000]
negate: 0
occupied_thresh: 0.65 #not used
free_thresh: 0.196    #not used
mode: raw
```

`vi_node` reads a cost map from a service `cost_map`. In `launch/vi_turtle_online.launch`, you can find the following lines so as to provice the cost map through `cost_map`. 

```
  <node pkg="map_server" name="cost_map" type="map_server" args="$(find value_iteration)/maps/cost.yaml">
    <remap from="static_map" to="cost_map" />
    <remap from="map" to="cost_map_for_vi" />  <!-- This line avoids this node to provide the map to RViz. -->
  </node>
```

### vi_controller_turtle_env

This node receives the 2D Nav Goal from RViz and sends it to vi_node. It is implemented in `scripts/vi_turtle_env.py`.

## Notes

### What's the cost means?

It is the sum of costs from a pose (position + orientation) to a point of goal. The cost means the time. Therefore, it means the time required to reach the goal if immediate penarties don't exist. As shown in the parameter list, we can define some kinds of immediate penalties, which are quantified in units of seconds.
